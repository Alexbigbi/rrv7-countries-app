# Welcome to RESTExplorer!

This website uses the REST Countries API to display comprehensive information about countries from around the world.

This is part of a tutorial by PedroTech that makes use of ReactJS, React Router v7, TailwindCSS and TypeScript.

Explore the many countries of our world in our interactive page and learn their capitals, population, flags, official names and much more.

Our goal was to learn RRV7, TailwindCSS, ReactJS and TypeScript by building a highly responsive, modern and feature-rich web application.
